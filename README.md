Audio-spatial conversion from computer vision
============================================

This is my Thesis project for my undergraduate studies at CUCEI (University Center for Exact Sciencies and Engineering
from University of Guadalajara).

It will originally be cross compiled for Android using OpenCV and OpenAL. Later versions will use a stand-alone embedded
system for image processing on a debian-based distro using also OpenCV. Some options are the RaspberryPi, the Arduino Yun, 
the BeagleBone Black, the EfikaMX by Genesi or the Dev board for the i.MX6 from freescale.

It captures an image, process the colors and shapes on a closed environment and it translate them to harmonies, 
sounds and melodies using audiospatial sound to locate the object in a 3D space created on the mind. It will be tested
for blind children and adults as an assitive device for daily life.
